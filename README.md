# VS Code Recorder Extension

This extension provides functionality to record changes made in the active text editor in Visual Studio Code. The changes are recorded in a CSV file and can be processed to generate output files in SRT and JSON formats.

## Features

The VS Code Recorder Extension is designed to track and record changes made in the active text editor. It captures every change, including text insertions, deletions, and modifications, and records them in a CSV file. This file can then be processed to generate output files in SRT and JSON formats, providing a detailed log of changes made during a coding session.

## Usage

Choose the format in which you want to export the data (SRT or JSON or both).
